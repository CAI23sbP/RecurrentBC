## Explanation this package ##

This package is a Recurrent Behavior Cloning.

And it is compatible with [Imitation library](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/imitation)

It is okay to use a expert dataset which is from human , whether it has recurrent state or not (like lstm_state or gru_state).

## Training ##

```python3 train_gru_bc.py```

## result in BipedalWalker-v3 ##
